    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a hearty and comforting Italian dish made of layers of wide pasta sheets, 
        rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The traditional version is typically made with ground beef or pork, 
        simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a blend of savory herbs. These layers are alternated with generous amounts of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, 
        creating a dish that's both filling and flavorful.
    </p>
    <p>This versatile recipe can be customized with different ingredients, such as vegetables, mushrooms, 
        or even a vegetarian ricotta filling, offering various options for different tastes and dietary preferences. 
        After baking in the oven, the lasagna becomes a golden, bubbly masterpiece, perfect for family gatherings, celebrations, or a comforting dinner on a chilly evening.

    <h3>Steps for Cooking Lasagna:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Noodles:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package instructions, drain, and set aside. If using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Make the Meat Sauce:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until soft and fragrant (about 3 minutes).</li>
          <li>Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until browned. Break it up into small pieces as it cooks.</li>
          <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce (if using). Add the basil, oregano, salt, and pepper, and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Filling:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with 1 ½ cups of mozzarella cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan, and the egg (if using). Mix until well combined.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
          <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
          <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
          <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle with a little mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
          <li>Repeat the layers, finishing with a top layer of noodles, sauce, and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with a little cooking spray) and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
          <li>After 25-30 minutes, remove the foil and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
          <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
