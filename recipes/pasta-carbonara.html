        <h3>Steps for Cooking Pasta alla Carbonara:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
              <li>Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li><strong>Prepare the Pancetta or Guanciale:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
              <li>Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li><strong>Make the Carbonara Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
              <li>Set aside until ready to combine with the pasta.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it directly to the skillet with pancetta or guanciale, tossing to coat.</li>
              <li>Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing continuously to create a creamy sauce (do not scramble the eggs).</li>
              <li>If the sauce is too thick, gradually add a bit of the reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Top with additional black pepper and fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
              <li>Serve immediately while hot!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
